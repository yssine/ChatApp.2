#ChatApp.2
This is the 2nd version of my application  which is a GUI based istead of CLI (previous version).
It is worth mentionning that this application is not 100% operational, however, it does the job of sending/reciving messages to/from clients connected to the netwerk.
In the next versions, I will try to include authentication mechanism and I will try to hot the server so we dont have to enter the ip address every time.
With thats said, stay tuned and expect to see more updates soon.
